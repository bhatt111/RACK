# Ingestion Script

This python script uses the Node Execution Group REST API
to populate the Turnstile demo data into RACK in a Box.

More documentation on the REST API is available on the
[REST API Swagger Demo](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/REST-API-Swagger-Demo)
and [REST cookbook](https://github.com/ge-semtk/semtk/wiki/REST-cookbook) wiki pages.

Depending on where you are running this script you'll need
to change the `URL_BASE` to point to your RACK in a Box installation.
